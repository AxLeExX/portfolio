      currently majoring in manufacturing engineering. I recently got married

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>I really like computer science, but unfortunately I find it to be
      very difficult for me. As a result, I haven't worked on very many projects
      yet, but here's a list of a few I have worked on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Making a computer program in C++ that takes a datalog program as input
        and evaluates it.</li>
      <li>Writing a program in C++ that translates numbers into roman numerals.
        </li>
      <li>Creating a "choose your own adventure" game in Python.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I have worked in the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Student technician -- SVVSD -- 2 years</li>
      <li>Mixed martial arts assistant instructor -- Origin Martial Arts -- 3
        years</li>
      <li>Apple certified repair technician -- BYU -- 2 years</li>
